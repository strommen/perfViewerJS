# perf-view.js

perf-view.js is a script to effortlessly display performance metrics on any page.  When the script is initialized, it shows a notification bar with the page load time and a link to display a waterfall chart.  All of this is done in JavaScript based on the HTML5 navigation and resource timings API. 

## Integrating perf-view
To use perf-view.js on your website, simply add it to your page and initialize it from a window load event handler.  For example:

	<script src="scripts/perf-view.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		window.addEventListener('load', function() { perfView.init(); }, false);
	</script>

If you want to, you can initialize it anytime _after_ the window load event.

### Customization

There are a few customization options supported.  To use these, pass an object to `init()` with values for any of the following properties:

- errorThreshold - by default, perf-view shows the load time in red if it exceeds a threshold of 2000 milliseconds.  This value is customizable.
- containerId - by default, perf-view will create a new container div for all its contents. If you want to control where it does, you can specify an ID.
- useDefaultCSS - by default, perf-view loads all its own CSS.  If you are styling perf-view yourself, set this to false.

For example, to set a lower alert threshold of 1.5s, you would initialize perf-view as follows:

	window.addEventListener('load', function() { perfView.init({ errorThreshold: 75 }); }, false);


### Custom CSS
perf-view ships with its own CSS.  If you want to customize this, go for it!  All elements generated by perf-view have classes starting with "perf-view-"...see the CSS file to get started.

If you include the CSS in an external file, you'll want to make sure to set `useDefaultCSS: false` in the init options.

## Bookmarklet
To see perf-view.js on any page, use the following bookmarklet. (This may not always work depending on the page's content security policy).

## What's Next
There are a few features I'd like to add:

- Prevent the labels for DOMContentLoaded and window.onload from obscuring other labels. 
- Indicate cross-origin resources, since their `responseStart` timing is always zero so we cannot measure latency.
- Get a better workflow for modifying the CSS (rather than CSS text manually inlined into the JS file...)
- Render everything in an iframe so it doesn't inherit styles from the original document.
- Display resource download sizes for each row in the chart (perhaps by making HEAD requests?).
- Ability to specify a custom metric rather than page load (i.e. window.onload)
- Display User Timings on the chart
- Break down "latency" into its DNS lookup, TCP connection, and SSL handshake components 
- Export of the resource timings (possibly in HAR format)

## Acknowledgements

I was inspired to implement this by two separate talks at VelocityConf 2015, by [Steve Souders](http://www.slideshare.net/souders/designperformance-velocity-2015) and [Allison McKnight](https://speakerdeck.com/aemcknig/crafting-performance-alerting-tools).  I also borrowed a few points from [a similar script written by Andy Davies](//andydavies.github.io/waterfall).  Another influence on this is the excellent [Glimpse for ASP.NET](http://getglimpse.com/).
